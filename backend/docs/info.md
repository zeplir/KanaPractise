# Some info regarding Japanese

## General Info
There are three different alphabets in the Japanes language,
these are Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. They are all used for
different purposes and the point of this file is to touch that
in a smaller sense as to get you familiar with it.

## Hiragana
Hiragana is widely used in Japanese, as both construction for words
but also for what is known as particles in Japanese. This is a way
to conjugate and change words and sentences in different ways. For
example the hiragana か (ka), is added to the end of sentences to
make it a question. Now this might not always be the case, but it is
a common usecase. Another common one is は (ha) but read as (wa),
which is a topic marker. For example:

I am Steve
Watashi wa Steve
私*は*スティーブ

## Katakana
Katakana is used in Japanese for foreign loan words. Common use
cases are foregin names, but also words, such as coffee and buss.

Bus: バス
Coffe: コーヒー

## Kanji
Kanji is the biggest of the three and and uses chinese characters.
These characters might differ a bit from traditional chinese characters,
but in Japanes they are known as kanji and are used in a few ways. There
is a Japanese and Chinese way of pronouncing these characters. These are
called on-yomi and kun-yomi.

### On-yomi
On-yomi is the chinese way of pronoucing the characters and this is done
when the kanjis are grouped into clusters. For example:

Japan
Nihon
日本

Here the kanji for sun/day 日 (ni) is used in combination with the kanji
本 (hon), which means book or origin. Often the on-yomi is written in
katakana, whilst kun-yomim is written in hiragana.

### Kun-yomi
Kun-yomi is the Japanese way of pronouncing kanji, and is used when kanji
are isolated from other kanji. Please note that both kun- and on-yomi
sometimes have multiple pronounciations and sometimes exceptions to
those pronounciations, (*yeah I know it's now hard enough already*).

## How do I learn?
I recommend that you start with Hiragana and then move on to Katakana.
Why? Hiragana is really usefull to know well, since it is used a lot in
Japanese, and you need to start with something :P. And trust me, its gets
easier, when you know Hiragana, Katakana is easier to learn than when starting
from scratch. For example (ni):

Hiragana: に
Katakana: ニ

As you can see, they share some similarities, making it easier to remember.
When it comes to kanji, my apporach is learning first kanji - meaning.
Then kanji - meaning - kunyomi. The reason for this is because you will feel
the progression, but also learning "small" words, can make kunyomi words easier
later, since perhaps if you know 日 and 本 sun and origin, origin of the sun,
you can determine that it is something to do with that, i.e. Japan in this case.
Ofcourse this is only how I did things and I'm sure there are better or worse
ways, just sharing what I know.
