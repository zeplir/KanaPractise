# flash-cards
This is a project to make some simple flash cards that can train yourself on different things on, and where the goal is for the program to determine how well you are at certain things and train you more at the ones you are bad at.

## Notes
- Please note that the hiragana currently only support 'normal' hiragana, hiragana with dakuten and hiragana with handakuten. Implementations for diagraphs and are to be added in the future. I.e. this is mainly focused for just remembering the hiragana right now. Same applies for the katakana.
- Also please make sure that your terminal supports japanese characters in order for the prorgarm to work properly.
- Note I have only included the most common hiragana and katakana, and not ones that aren't in use anymore. This might need refining in the future, since i might have forgotten some of them.
- The data is currently in both CSV and JSON format, due to the fact that I'm not yet sure which format will be easiest to work with. But im currently leaning towards JSON.
- Currently it is more of a CLI program than flash-cards, but first the logic will be implemented for CLI and then a UI will be made for the program.
